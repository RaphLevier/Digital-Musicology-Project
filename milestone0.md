# Digital-Musicology-Project

-	Research question :
I want to study how leitmotivs and themes are declined in movie soundtracks, to caracterize how famous composers transform a melody to represent the emotional changes of a character throughout a movie. I believe that it is possible to do this by studying, for some famous composers, how the pitch, the rythm, the number of voices and especially the transposition of a leitmotiv evolve during a movie in relation to the emotion the music tries to reflect.  This technique, of declining a leitmotiv, was first used by Beethoven and Schubert, and became an essential principle for composing movie soundtracks in the 20th century. It is called thematic transformation. Basically, the variation of the leitmotiv reflect the psychological or emotional changes within a character, or the reaction of character to a place or an object, to help the viewer understand how to interpret a scene. For me, it’s a very interesting subject because it could allow us to characterize how a leitmotiv evolves in order to express specific emotions. We also could try to find a method which details how to transform certain characteristics of a leitmotiv to achieve this goal. 

-	Concepts and data :
Concretely, we will have to choose a leitmotiv for each movie that we selected, and then pick several tracks of the score where we can find the same leitmotiv. The project will study how the leitmotiv is declined in terms of arrangement, pitch, rythmn, transposition. I think we could try to assign each of these variation to the « emotion» that it tries to create. Then we could create sort of a map of these variations for several composers and compare them. The concept of Leitmotiv variations is called « thematic transformation », but I don’t know much about it  yet, I’ll have to study the theory so that I can understand how it works. So I think we will need datasets containing the Midi notes of all the track of a movie score, and I couldn’t find them yet. I could probably use the sheets on musescore and select the parts that correspond to the variation of a leitmotiv. 

-	Methods :
I don’t yet have the methods in mind, even if I have an idea of how to proceed (detailed in the paragraph above).

-	Literature :
I didn’t find publications or paper that specifically discusses this subject, which is why I feel like the subject might be too ambitious. However, I’m really interested in working on motifs and how they can be reused. The idea came from this video How to Transform a Leitmotif - YouTube, and I found some analysis of thematic transformations on this website : Thematic Transformation in Rózsa's Score for Ben-Hur - Film Music Notes, Thematic Transformation in Korngold’s Robin Hood - Film Music Notes.

-	Support :
I think I’ll need support to find documentation on the subject (papers and publications), and maybe to find the right datasets.

I didn't find a group, though I posted a message on Piazza, nobody answered.
